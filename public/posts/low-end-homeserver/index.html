  <p>By low end, I mean <em>ancient</em> hardware. For example, my &ldquo;NAS&rdquo; with an Intel Pentium E5400.</p>
<p>This post is more of a list of resources for squeezing a little bit extra power out of obsolete hardware, though some of these tips will work for modern constrained devices like Raspberry Pis. I might update this as I find more useful tips.</p>
<h1 id="zram-as-swap">ZRAM as Swap</h1>
<p>You can trade some CPU power for additional &ldquo;RAM&rdquo; with ZRAM. Depending on the kind of services you&rsquo;ll be hosting, this may be a viable option to squeeze more services into the same hardware.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Zram">ZRAM on the Arch Linux wiki</a>. I recommend at least checking out the section on <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Zram#Optimizing_swap_on_zram">optimizing swap on ZRAM</a> even if you&rsquo;re not using an Arch distro.</li>
<li><a href="https://wiki.debian.org/ZRam">Setting up ZRAM on Debian-based distros</a></li>
</ul>
<p>While it might be tempting to make a huge ZRAM partition, doing that might <em>degrade</em> system stability, rather than improve it. Keeping too much data in ZRAM will cause additional latency and excessive CPU usage.</p>
<p>In my setup, I use ZRAM and SSD swaps, both with the same size (2GB). I found that it&rsquo;s a good balance between compressed memory and CPU usage. YMMV.</p>
<h1 id="small-stuff">Small stuff</h1>
<ul>
<li>Use the latest kernel version available on your distro&rsquo;s repositories.</li>
<li>Use Wireguard (or Tailscale) as your VPN. They&rsquo;re crazy fast. I haven&rsquo;t seen anyone with a homelab use anything other than those two in a long time, but I thought I&rsquo;d mention it anyway.</li>
<li>If you can avoid using Nextcloud, do so. If you <em>really</em> like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250414202236/https://wiki.futo.org/index.php/Introduction_to_a_Self_Managed_Life:_a_13_hour_%26_28_minute_presentation_by_FUTO_software#Nextcloud_Notes_to_replace_Google_Keep">a specific feature</a>, go ahead, but I wouldn&rsquo;t use it for anything more.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="microoptimizations">Microoptimizations</h1>
<p>This section is for stuff that either didn&rsquo;t work or had minimal impact on performance/throughput.</p>
<h2 id="forcing-nginx-to-use-chacha20">Forcing NGINX to use ChaCha20</h2>
<p>It&rsquo;s theoretically faster than AES on devices without AES-NI. I&rsquo;ve only tested this on the latest Debian Testing NGINX version at the time of writing (1.26.3).</p>





<pre tabindex="0"><code># Microoptimization: force ChaCha20 whenever possible, since I don&#39;t have AES-NI
ssl_ciphers &#34;ECDHE-ECDSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305:ECDHE-RSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305:ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:DHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384&#34;;

ssl_conf_command Ciphersuites TLS_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256:TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256:TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384;
ssl_prefer_server_ciphers on;</code></pre><p>It kinda sorta worked, but the bandwidth improvement was so small it&rsquo;s not worth it.</p>
